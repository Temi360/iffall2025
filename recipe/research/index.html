<!--	
Over the next few weeks, you will be designing and building a web page that presents a recipe. We'll start that project by finding/choosing a recipe, and doing some design research. This week, you will upload an HTML document that presents the following:

The recipe content (at minimum, this includes title, description, ingredients, instructions, source attribution)
Sample imagery (this may or may not be actual images from your recipe source, it might instead be samples of photos/illustrations representing the type of images you intend to use)
Three links to recipe websites you have found, with a short (2-3 sentences) written review/critique for each, explaining what makes this site a good reference
Three links to non-recipe websites with stylistic or communication techniques that might inform your own design, also with a short written rationale-->
