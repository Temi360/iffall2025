        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
</header>
<ol>
<li>My name is Temi Ijisesan. I am a Senior and  Communication Design Major</li>
<li>I have experience coding with html, css, javascript, and java, and I wanted to take this class to solidify my skills and come out with a cool project! It's also required for my major, lol.</li>
<li>Yes, I've coded websites in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and REACT. My first internship in college I made an animated website using REACT and svgs which was really cool. <a href = "https://temiijisesan.vercel.app/">Here's the link.</a>I've also taken a couple web development classes online through Codepath.</li>
<li>I hope to learn how to use CSS rules more efficiently because I feel like I often brute force them.</li>
<li>I expect designing for screen to be more interactive and narrative in a different way than paper. On paper you flip a page to get to the next part, but you can't really do that on the screen. </Li>
<li>I think that a really well designed website is <a href = "https://abetkaua.com/en/">Project Typeface Alphabet of the Ukrainian Identity</a> website. I really enjoy the playful simplicity of the pages and the engaging layout.</li>
    <li>
  I'm going to highlight this studio's website I really like called funnyworks because I think the design, and animation style within the website really highlights the work they do in a really engaging way. So I think in this way they're doing a great job with communication! <a href = "https://stubborn-room.funnyworks.co.kr">Funnyworks</a></li>   
</li>
<li>A website that I think really well is <a href = "https://ellipsus.com/#introduction">Ellipsus's website.</a>What stood out to me was how their website is very simple in what it is communicating, and logically flows linearly design wise. Having no idea what it was about, I was easily able to access the tools on the site and understand their mission.</li>
